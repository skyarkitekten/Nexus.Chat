# PRD: Chat-Based Feature Definition & Collaboration

## Summary

A conversational workspace where product teams can explore existing features for a given product/domain, discuss potential additions, and collaboratively define new features — all within a single chat thread that integrates feature history, requirements, and decision context. We’re not just talking about a static backlog lookup; you’ve got an agent doing semantic + lexical search over historical feature data, then using RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to draft new feature definitions and user stories.

### Narrative

Imagine walking into a new product team’s kickoff. Normally, you’d dig through old docs, stale tickets, and scattered Slack messages to understand the current state. With this chat feature, you simply enter “Checkout domain chat” and see every existing feature, the decisions behind them, and active discussions on what’s next.

No more “Didn’t we already talk about this?” or “Where’s the doc for that?” Instead, the conversation *is* the record. When someone suggests a new feature, the system instantly drafts a scoped description. Stakeholders join in to refine details. In minutes, you’ve gone from idea to a ready-for-backlog feature, with all context preserved.

It’s a living, breathing source of truth and it lives where your team already works. This chat isn’t just reactive, it’s contextually intelligent

## Problem Statement

Feature ideation and definition are often fragmented across docs, tickets, and chat tools, leading to lost context, duplicated ideas, and slow alignment. This results in:

* **Knowledge silos**: PMs and designers unaware of existing features or previous discussions.
* **Rework and delays**: Ideas resurface multiple times without context or clear decisions.
* **Inefficient onboarding**: New team members can’t easily see what’s been done and why.

We need a single place where the history of feature decisions, the current state of the product, and the team’s live conversation are all in one flow — discoverable, contextual, and actionable.

## Goals

### Business Goals

* Increase speed of feature definition from idea → scoped requirement.
* Reduce duplicated or conflicting feature requests by auto-checking history.
* Improve the clarity of product owners's vision and prepare engineering teams.
* Increase stakeholder confidence in feature definitions by grounding them in existing work.
* Boost adoption of our platform as the “source of truth” for product ideation.

### User Goals

* Ask “What features already exist for [domain]?” and get a precise, AI-curated list.
* Propose a feature and have the system immediately flag similar or related features.
* Receive a complete first draft of the feature spec and user stories, generated from prior examples.
* Collaborate on refining that draft directly in chat.

### Non-Goals

* Fully automated feature approval — human review is required
* Building full project management (sprints, tasks).
* Automated feature scoring or prioritization (future possibility).
* Real-time design mockups (integration could come later).
* Generating visual designs (future scope).

## User Stories

1. **As a PM**, I can propose a feature, and the system automatically surfaces similar past features and their decisions before drafting a new definition.
2. **As a designer**, I can see how a similar feature was implemented before starting design work.
3. **As an engineer**, I can see the historical technical considerations of similar features to avoid repeating mistakes.
4. **As a new team member**, I can learn the product’s feature history through chat queries.

### User Experience (Step-by-Step Flow)

1. **Entry point**: User opens a chat tied to a specific domain (e.g., “Payments” or “Onboarding”).
2. **Context auto-loads**: Chat sidebar displays existing features for that domain with metadata (owner, status, date added).
3. **Discovery via natural language**: User types a query like, “What’s missing in our onboarding flow?” → system surfaces gaps or unbuilt ideas from backlog.
4. **Proposal creation**: User types “Let’s add social login” → system generates a draft feature definition inline, pulling from templates.
5. **Collaborative refinement**: Team members @mention others, add details, and lock in scope directly in the chat.
6. **Commit to backlog**: One-click action sends finalized feature definition to the backlog system with metadata and link to chat thread.
7. **Searchable history**: At any time, user can search past threads for a feature name or keyword.

---

### Success Metrics

* **Time-to-definition**: Average time from idea → finalized feature spec (target: -40%).
* **Duplication rate**: % of new ideas already existing in backlog (target: <5%).
* **Engagement**: Weekly active contributors per domain chat.
* **Adoption**: % of feature definitions created in chat vs. outside tools.

---

### Technical Considerations

* **Integrations**: Sync with Azure DevOps/GitHub for pushing features to backlog.
* **Data model**: Each chat linked to a domain, features stored with metadata and linked thread history.
* **Search**: Indexed across chat logs + feature metadata for instant retrieval.
* **Permissions**: Role-based access to certain domains and feature creation rights.
* **AI assistance**: Optional — for auto-suggesting missing features or drafting definitions.
