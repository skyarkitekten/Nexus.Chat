# PRD: Chat-Based Feature Definition & Collaboration

This is a chat-based “feature definition and collaboration” workspace, where a chat UI is the medium for:

1. **Discovering existing features** for a domain
2. **Defining new ones** through conversation
3. **Collaborating with others** to refine scope and requirements

## Summary

A conversational workspace where product teams can explore existing features for a given product/domain, discuss potential additions, and collaboratively define new features — all within a single chat thread that integrates feature history, requirements, and decision context.

### Narrative

Imagine walking into a new product team’s kickoff. Normally, you’d dig through old docs, stale tickets, and scattered Slack messages to understand the current state. With this chat feature, you simply enter “Checkout domain chat” and see every existing feature, the decisions behind them, and active discussions on what’s next.

No more “Didn’t we already talk about this?” or “Where’s the doc for that?” Instead, the conversation *is* the record. When someone suggests a new feature, the system instantly drafts a scoped description. Stakeholders join in to refine details. In minutes, you’ve gone from idea to a ready-for-backlog feature, with all context preserved.

It’s a living, breathing source of truth — and it lives where your team already works.

## Problem Statement

Feature ideation and definition are often fragmented across docs, tickets, and chat tools, leading to lost context, duplicated ideas, and slow alignment. This results in:

* **Knowledge silos**: PMs and designers unaware of existing features or previous discussions.
* **Rework and delays**: Ideas resurface multiple times without context or clear decisions.
* **Inefficient onboarding**: New team members can’t easily see what’s been done and why.

We need a single place where the history of feature decisions, the current state of the product, and the team’s live conversation are all in one flow — discoverable, contextual, and actionable.

## Goals

### Business Goals

* Increase speed of feature definition from idea → scoped requirement.
* Reduce duplicated or conflicting feature requests.
* Improve collaboration between PMs, designers, and engineers.
* Boost adoption of our platform as the “source of truth” for product ideation.

### User Goals

* Instantly see a list of existing features in a domain.
* Understand the rationale and decision history behind features.
* Propose and refine new features directly within chat.
* Collaborate with teammates without switching tools.

### Non-Goals

* Building full project management (sprints, tasks).
* Automated feature scoring or prioritization (future possibility).
* Real-time design mockups (integration could come later).

## User Stories

1. **As a PM**, I can ask the chat “What features exist for our checkout flow?” and get an organized list with details.
2. **As a designer**, I can see previous discussions about a feature before making design decisions.
3. **As an engineer**, I can clarify requirements in the same thread where the idea originated.
4. **As a new team member**, I can quickly catch up on the domain’s features and their context without hunting through multiple tools.

### User Experience (Step-by-Step Flow)

1. **Entry point**: User opens a chat tied to a specific domain (e.g., “Payments” or “Onboarding”).
2. **Context auto-loads**: Chat sidebar displays existing features for that domain with metadata (owner, status, date added).
3. **Discovery via natural language**: User types a query like, “What’s missing in our onboarding flow?” → system surfaces gaps or unbuilt ideas from backlog.
4. **Proposal creation**: User types “Let’s add social login” → system generates a draft feature definition inline, pulling from templates.
5. **Collaborative refinement**: Team members @mention others, add details, and lock in scope directly in the chat.
6. **Commit to backlog**: One-click action sends finalized feature definition to the backlog system with metadata and link to chat thread.
7. **Searchable history**: At any time, user can search past threads for a feature name or keyword.

---

### Success Metrics

* **Time-to-definition**: Average time from idea → finalized feature spec (target: -40%).
* **Duplication rate**: % of new ideas already existing in backlog (target: <5%).
* **Engagement**: Weekly active contributors per domain chat.
* **Adoption**: % of feature definitions created in chat vs. outside tools.

---

### Technical Considerations

* **Integrations**: Sync with Jira/Linear for pushing features to backlog.
* **Data model**: Each chat linked to a domain, features stored with metadata and linked thread history.
* **Search**: Indexed across chat logs + feature metadata for instant retrieval.
* **Permissions**: Role-based access to certain domains and feature creation rights.
* **AI assistance**: Optional — for auto-suggesting missing features or drafting definitions.
